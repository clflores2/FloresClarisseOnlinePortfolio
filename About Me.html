									<h3 class="major">Clarisse Facts</h3>
									<p>Well, you're in this page now. This page is haunted! Just kidding, it isn't. But you're welcome to check my About Me facts.</p>

									<p>I love my family and my friends. I have always loved the colors purple, red, white, blue, and yellow. I want to travel the world with them. I also want to be able to pay for the <strong>WHOLE</strong> trip. I want to repay my family even though that isn't enough. I want to also travel the world on my own or with a friend. I want to have a family of my own. I don't like it when someone is lonely. I am Christian and I wear skirts. I love flowers. Sometimes, I think of it as sad because it reminds me of funerals. My last name is Flores. I go to Burton High School and I'm graduating in year 2018. I want to either become a nurse, pharmacist, interior designer, math teacher, or fashion designer.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Random</h3>
									<p>If I had all the money in the world, I would separate it in percentage. 20% to places where people have no food or shelter, 20% to my church, 10% to my aunts and uncles' families and 10% to each of my parents and I get the rest. I would use that 30% to make a house for my whole family. I will design it. We would have our own pool, jacuzzi, gym, volleyball court, tetherball court, and many rooms including a guest room. I would also save up the rest of the money for when we get older.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Favorite Junk Food</h3>
											<p align="middle">I would rather choose chocolates over candies. I love Kit Kat, Tootsie Roll, Hersheys but what I favor the most are foreign chocolates like Moser Roth, Schogetten, and Tim Tams. I love Hot Cheetos, Lays Barbecue, and Hawaiian Sweet and Spicy Chips. <h3>Dreams in the Future</h3>
											<p>I would LOVE to go travel the whole world. I want to to see how different everyone is and the different cultures and traditions.</p>
